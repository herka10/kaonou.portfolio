        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello again, first of all, thank you for taking time to visit my portfolio. I started out my career in the finance field because I enjoyed math and numbers but after many attempts, I realized I was not into business. So now, I am currently changing careers and am super stoked to see where this takes me. I am currently attending a Coding Bootcamp and hope to complete it in February of 2023. Wish me luck!</p>
